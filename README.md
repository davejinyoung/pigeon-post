# Pigeon Post
Pigeon Post is a web app that connects to your Gmail inbox and uses AI to generate clear, concise summaries of your emails. Built with Angular (frontend) and Django (backend), it leverages the Gmail API and integrates with locally hosted LLMs via Ollama for private, offline summarization. This application is still in development.
